## R program for rprog-005 Assignment 2
## The file contains 2 functions that cache the inverse of a matrix: makeCacheMatrix and cachSolve
## Comments are included for key parts of the function.

## makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the matrix object returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has not already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve function retrieves the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
